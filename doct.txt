Hi Santiago, good afternoon.

Mary has already chosen a template for its website. The template selected is this one:

http://www.pixel-industry.com/html/musician/musician-html/home-page-music-artist.html

Please, get that template on your PC, and setup a simple website with this. Sections to be included are:
- Home: Just the main picture, and her name, with a link in the button to Bio
- Bio: Just put here another ppicture, and a placeholder, like it's on "About" section on the template
- Gallery: Here we'll include all other photos and a few videos; please check if it's better to embed videos directly from Youtube, or if better upload the video and media to the server and play it from there.
- Contact: She'll send us this section later, so just put a placeholder here.

Videos are:
